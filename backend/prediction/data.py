disease_info = {
    "Common Rust": {
        "symptoms": "Reddish-brown pustules appear on both sides of the leaves, often surrounded by yellow halos. Severe infections can lead to premature leaf death.",
        "prevention": "Plant resistant maize varieties, ensure proper field sanitation, and use crop rotation to break disease cycles.",
        "treatment": "Apply fungicides like strobilurins or triazoles at early infection stages for effective control."
    },
    "Gray Leaf Spot": {
        "symptoms": "Small, rectangular, gray to tan lesions with a narrow brown border appear on lower leaves first and gradually spread upwards.",
        "prevention": "Use disease-resistant hybrids, improve air circulation by avoiding dense planting, and manage crop residues to reduce fungal spores.",
        "treatment": "Apply fungicides like azoxystrobin or propiconazole at early symptom onset to prevent spread."
    },
    "Blight": {
        "symptoms": "Irregular, water-soaked lesions develop on leaves, which later turn brown with a yellowish border. Severe infections can cause leaf wilting and premature death.",
        "prevention": "Rotate crops, plant disease-resistant varieties, and manage weeds to reduce pathogen spread.",
        "treatment": "Use copper-based or systemic fungicides and avoid overhead irrigation to reduce moisture conditions that favor disease development."
    },
    "Healthy": {
        "symptoms": "Leaves are green and free from visible spots, lesions, or discoloration. The plant exhibits normal growth with no signs of stress or disease.",
        "prevention": "Maintain proper crop rotation, ensure balanced fertilization, and regularly monitor for early signs of disease or pest infestations.",
        "treatment": "No treatment needed; continue best agronomic practices to maintain plant health."
