      title: 'STRIPE DOWNY MILDEW',
      description: `In Nepal, 2 types are found: brown stripe downy mildew and philipino downy mildew, caused by Sclerophthora rassy var. zeae and Peronosclerospora philipinensis respectively. In brown stripe type, symptoms appear on leaves as yellowish lesions between veins, which later turn brown. In the morning, downy fungal growth appears around the lesions.`,

      title: 'PHILIPINO DOWNY MILDEW',
      description: `In Nepal, 2 types are found: brown stripe downy mildew and philipino downy mildew, caused by Sclerophthora rassy var. zeae and Peronosclerospora philipinensis respectively. In the philipino type, crazy top symptoms occur, such as dwarf plants with many leaves originating from a limited region. Leaves become small-sized with chlorotic, sometimes whitish, appearances.`,

      title: 'Common Rust',
      description: `Common rust is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi. Late occurring infections have limited impact on yield.
  
  The fungus overwinters on plants in southern states and airborne spores are wind-blown to northern states during the growing season.
  
  Disease development is favored by cool, moist weather (60 – 70◦ F).Symptoms of common rust often appear after silking.
  
  Small, round to elongate brown pustules form on both leaf surfaces and other above ground parts of the plant.
  
  As the pustules mature they become brown to black.
  
  If disease is severe, the leaves may yellow and die early. `},

      title: 'Gray Leaf Spot',
      description: `Gray leaf spot (GLS) is a foliar fungal disease that affects grasses. In grasses other than maize it is caused by Pyricularia grisea, which only infects perennial ryegrass, tall fescue, and St. Augustine grass in places with warm and rainy climates.
      Early symptoms of gray leaf spot can be seen on leaves as small, spherical lesions with a yellow halo around them. These first lesions may be tan or brown before fungal sporulation begins. The initial disease can be hard to identify as gray leaf spot at this stage because it looks similar to eyespot and common rust. However, as the lesions mature they elongate into rectangular, narrow, brown to gray spots that usually develop on the lower leaves and spread upward on the plant during the season. The lesions elongate and expand parallel to the leaf veins and can be 1.5 to 2 inches long. `

     title: 'Blight ',
      description: `Blight is a rapid and complete chlorosis, browning, then death of plant tissues such as leaves, branches, twigs, or floral organs.[1] Accordingly, many diseases that primarily exhibit this symptom are called blights. `
